# Parameters Extraction from Bee Movements

This project explores bee movements in the arena. The movements are first tracked with ctrax and the tracking results are saved in a csv 
file. From the csv file we extract the parameters such as probability of turning and stopping.

There are 3 main parts of this project:

* checking for distribution parameters
* plotting all paths the bees pass
* testing the quality of ctrax with csv files generated from other sources

## Requirements

To run this tool correctly you will need the following:

* [python 2.7.6](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

## Definition and Usage

### test_distribution
Module for analyzing ctrax tracking results. Given a csv file generated by ctrax
 this module extracts the probability of turn, stop and meeting in movement of
 bees in the arena.

 Input:
 
    <path_to_ctrax_csv>

Example:

    python test_distribution.py ~/ctrax.csv

### path_generator
Module for displaying/saving all bee paths found in the given csv file.

Input:
    
    <path_to_csv_file> [<output_directory>]

Examples:

    python ~/ASSISIbf/example_file.csv
    python ~/ASSISIbf/example_file.csv ./tmp/output_dir
    
### test_csv_correlation
Module for testing correlation between two csv files. The implementation tests
the difference in x_px, y_px, and angle parameters for the same video file.

Input:

    <path_to_ctrax_csv> <path_to_graz_csv>

Example:

    python test_csv_correlation.py ~/ctrax.csv ~/Downloads/Ger09-069.csv
